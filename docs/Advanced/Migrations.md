# Migrations

**Schema migrations** is the mechanism by which you can add new tables and columns to the database in a backward-compatible way. That is, when users of your app upgrade from version 1.0 to 2.0 that have a different database schema, they won't notice a thing.

⚠️ TODO: Migrations are currently work in progress and will be **available soon**. This is the last bit necessary to [use WatermelonDB in production](../Roadmap.md). If you want to use WatermelonDB in your app, but are concerned about this, or want more information, please file an Issue or [contact @radex directly](https://github.com/radex)
