# Changelog

## Unreleased

### BREAKING CHANGES

- **iOS Installation change**. You need to add this line to your Podfile: `pod 'simdjson', path: '../node_modules/@nozbe/simdjson'`
- Deprecated `new Database({ actionsEnabled: false })` options is now removed. Actions are always enabled.
- Deprecated `new SQLiteAdapter({ synchronous: true })` option is now removed. Use `{ jsi: true }` instead.
- Deprecated `Q.unsafeLokiFilter` is now removed. Use `Q.unsafeLokiTransform((raws, loki) => raws.filter(raw => ...))` instead.
- Deprecated `Query.hasJoins` is now removed
- Changes to `LokiJSAdapter` constructor options:
  - `indexedDBSerializer` -> `extraIncrementalIDBOptions: { serializeChunk, deserializeChunk }`
  - `onIndexedDBFetchStart` -> `extraIncrementalIDBOptions: { onFetchStart }`
  - `onIndexedDBVersionChange` -> `extraIncrementalIDBOptions: { onversionchange }`
  - `autosave: false` -> `extraLokiOptions: { autosave: false }`
- Changes to Internal APIs. These were never meant to be public, and so are unlikely to affect you:
  - `Model._isCommited`, `._hasPendingUpdate`, `._hasPendingDelete` have been removed and changed to `Model._pendingState`
  - `Collection.unsafeClearCache()` is no longer exposed
- Values passed to `adapter.setLocal()` are now validated to be strings. This is technically a bug fix, since local storage was always documented to only accept strings, however applications may have relied on this lack of validation. Adding this validation was necessary to achieve consistent behavior between SQLiteAdapter and LokiJSAdapter
- `unsafeSql` passed to `appSchema` will now also be called when dropping and later recreating all database indices on large batches. A second argument was added so you can distinguish between these cases. See Schema docs for more details.
- **Changes to sync change tracking**. The behavior of `record._raw._changed` and `record._raw._status` (a.k.a. `record.syncStatus`) has changed. This is unlikely to be a breaking change to you, unless you're writing your own sync engine or rely on these low-level details.
  - Previously, _changed was always empty when _status=created. Now, _changed is not populated during initial creation of a record, but a later update will add changed fields to _changed. This change was necessary to fix a long-standing Sync bug.

### Deprecations

- `database.action(() => {})` is now deprecated. Use `db.write(() => {})` instead (or `db.read(() => {})` if you only need consistency but are not writing any changes to DB)
- `@action` is now deprecated. Use `@writer` or `@reader` instead
- `.subAction()` is now deprecated. Use `.callReader()` or `.callWriter()` instead
- `Collection.unsafeFetchRecordsWithSQL()` is now deprecated. Use `collection.query(Q.unsafeSqlQuery("select * from...")).fetch()` instead.

### New features

- `db.write(writer => { ... writer.batch() })` - you can now call batch on the interface passed to a writer block
- **Fetching record IDs and unsafe raws.** You can now optimize fetching of queries that only require IDs, not full cached records:
  - `await query.fetchIds()` will return an array of record ids
  - `await query.unsafeFetchRaw()` will return an array of unsanitized, unsafe raw objects (use alongside `Q.unsafeSqlQuery` to exclude unnecessary or include extra columns)
  - advanced `adapter.queryIds()`, `adapter.unsafeQueryRaw` are also available
- **Raw SQL queries**. New syntax for running unsafe raw SQL queries:
  - `collection.query(Q.unsafeSqlQuery("select * from tasks where foo = ?", ['bar'])).fetch()`
  - You can now also run `.fetchCount()`, `.fetchIds()` on SQL queries
  - You can now safely pass values for SQL placeholders by passing an array
  - You can also observe an unsafe raw SQL query -- with some caveats! refer to documentation for more details
- **Unsafe raw execute**. You can now execute arbitrary SQL queries (SQLiteAdapter) or access Loki object directly (LokiJSAdapter) using `adapter.unsafeExecute` -- see docs for more details
- **Turbo Login**. You can now speed up the initial (login) sync by up to 5.3x with Turbo Login. See Sync docs for more details.
- New diagnostic tool - **debugPrintChanges**. See Sync documentation for more details

### Performance

- The order of Q. clauses in a query is now preserved - previously, the clauses could get rearranged and produce a suboptimal query
- [SQLite] `adapter.batch()` with large numbers of created/updated/deleted records is now between 16-48% faster
- [LokiJS] Querying and finding is now faster - unnecessary data copy is skipped
- [jsi] 15-30% faster querying on JSC (iOS) when the number of returned records is large
- [jsi] up to 52% faster batch creation (yes, that's on top of the improvement listed above!)
- Fixed a performance bug that caused observed items on a list observer with `.observeWithColumns()` to be unnecessarily re-rendered just before they were removed from the list

### Changes

- All Watermelon console logs are prepended with a üçâ tag
- Extra protections against improper use of writers/readers (formerly actions) have been added
- Queries with multiple top-level `Q.on('table', ...)` now produce a warning. Use `Q.on('table', [condition1, condition2, ...])` syntax instead.
- [jsi] WAL mode is now used

### Fixes

- [jsi] Fix a race condition where commands sent to the database right after instantiating SQLiteAdapter would fail
- [jsi] Fix incorrect error reporting on some sqlite errors
- [jsi] Fix issue where app would crash on Android/Hermes on reload
- [jsi] Fix IO errors on Android
- [sync] Fixed a long-standing bug that would cause records that are created before a sync and updated during sync's push to lose their most recent changes on a subsequent sync

### Internal

- Internal changes to SQLiteAdapter:
  - .batch is no longer available on iOS implementation
  - .batch/.batchJSON internal format has changed
  - .getDeletedRecords, destroyDeletedRecords, setLocal, removeLocal is no longer available
- encoded SQLiteAdapter schema has changed
- LokiJSAdapter has had many internal changes
