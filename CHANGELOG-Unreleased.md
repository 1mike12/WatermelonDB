# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Highlights

- Older version of iOS Installation docs said to import WatermelonDB's `SupportingFiles/Bridging.h` from your app project's `Bridging.h`.
  This is no longer recommended, and you should remove this import from your project. If this removal causes build issues, please file an issue.

### BREAKING CHANGES

### Fixes

- Fix compilation on Kotlin 1.7

### Performance
